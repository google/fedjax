class FederatedData(abc.ABC):
  """FederatedData interface for providing access to a federated dataset.

  A `FederatedData` object serves as a mapping from client ids to client
  datasets and client metadata.

  ##  Access methods with better IO efficiency

  For large federated datasets, it is not feasible to load all client datasets
  into memory at once (whereas loading a single client dataset is assumed to be
  feasible). Different implementations exist for different on disk storage
  formats. Since sequential read is much faster than random read for most
  storage technologies, `FederatedData` provides two types of methods for
  accessing client datasets,

  1.  `clients()` and `shuffled_clients()` are sequential read friendly, and
  thus recommended whenever appropriate.
  2.  `get_clients()` requires random read, but prefetching is possible. This
  should be preferred over `get_client()`.
  3.  `get_client()` is usually the slowest way of accessing client datasets,
  and is mostly intended for interactive exploration of a small number of
  clients.

  ##  Preprocessing

  `ClientDataset`s produced by `FederatedData` can hold a `Preprocessor`,
  customizable via `preprocess_batch()`. Additionally, another "client" level
  `Preprocessor`, customizable via `preprocess_client()`. can be used to apply
  transformations on examples from the entire client dataset before a
  ClientDataset is constructed.
